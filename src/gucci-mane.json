    "even though i brought the fifty dollars to the dope man like id done a thousand times before, i had no idea what i was getting into it wasnt like with the weed, where i was getting dime bags already packaged and serving my brothers friends i was on my own with this dope shit this was a totally different kind of product with a totally different type of clientele i had a buddy who knew more about dope than i did and he helped me cut up those slabs the first few times i picked up a fifty-dollar bag of crack was roughly 15 grams that got broken down into twenty-dollar bags, ten-dollar dime bags, and five-dollar nickel bags you could make a little more or a little less depending on how you played it, but most of the time there was a hundreddollar return on a fifty-dollar slab then you go get you a hundreddollar slab profit my buddy also knew a place where i could get a few of these sacks off he brought me to a run-down house on custer where we were greeted by an old lady with salt-and-pepper hair who introduced herself as miss k she was a nasty-looking woman, gangly thin with sores all over her face and body her home was even more disgusting than she was this spot was a smoking house for junkies and truck drivers, but she also had ladies in there selling pussy all sorts of foul shit going down there were little kids running around and rotting food littered everywhere id never seen anything like it the deal with miss k was that shed give me the green light to serve her people, but i had to hook her up with a sack free of charge a finders fee that was a fair enough deal, except i was so shook by the scene that i fumbled a few sacks on my way out this happened on more than one occasion, to the point that miss k told my buddy that i needed to tighten up and get my shit together she could see how rattled i was, that i didnt want to touch anything in there but it wasnt long before i grew numb to that environment i went on to serve miss k and her folks for years i didnt give a fuck about her sores or that house of horrors anymore i was making money i took to the dope game quickly i got creative with it innovative when other niggas went from selling dimes to selling nicks, i started selling three-dollar sacks my margins were slimmer but i was selling out quicker the junkies were buying them and then selling to each other for five dollars i saw those three-dollar sacks as an investment i was building my reputation along with my business hiding my activities from my momma was easy it wasnt that she didnt care, and i wouldnt call her naive either i would just say she worked a lot and i wasnt giving her any reason to question my whereabouts besides the occasional fistfight, i was never a troublemaker at school and id stayed bringing home good grades i was now a freshman at ronald e mcnair high school on bouldercrest and i was popular it was never hard to get someone to let me copy their homework when my momma did get suspicious i was always a step ahead of her id picked up a thing or two watching my father bullshit so many people i remember when she first noticed i had come into some money i came home one day with a seven-hundred-dollar leather 8-ball jacket i told her i won some money in a tunk game with my father that wasnt that far-fetched, because he did let me shoot dice and get in on the card games with his crew eventually my momma caught me red-handed, finding sacks of dope in my jeans when she was doing the laundry momma, you know that guy who be washing your car, cutting the grass, and taking out the trash for us? black? yeah, well black dont be doing all that for free, i said and he said he wants this stuff he dont want no money my momma knew black was a j and she knew dope was everywhere in mountain park the idea that someone had given this to me and i was passing it on to black wasnt that hard to believe even if it was, i knew my momma liked black junkie or not, he was a part of the community and she definitely liked having her car washed and the trash taken out, so i was off the hook no further questions with my momma off my back and my father out doing whatever it was he was up to, i was free to make plays by fifteen id been selling weed and dope for a few years but i still hadnt used myself my early experiences with miss k and the neighborhood crackheads had been a deterrent id interacted with countless fiends and they were so fucked-up and broke it turned me off to the idea of getting high my buddies had been pressing me to smoke weed for years but id resisted as a hustler i felt above using it seemed lame to me plus i wasnt about to let my friends peerpressure me but one day i was walking up to the gas station when i saw this girl who had moved into the apartments she was a couple of years older than me at mcnair she was the talk of the hood fine as hell she had on tight black spandex shorts, standing outside of her apartment and was talking on a cordless phone i was eying her when a car drove up and flagged me down i served them and took my time doing so i wanted her to know i was a hustler after they pulled off i approached her and asked if i could use her phone i called my trap back and was talking about all the moves id"

## Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles
- As my first build, planning out how to approach/structure this project was the most challenging. Implementing design changes and changing direction were key stress points.
- The letter highlighting was more intensive than I had anticipated.
- Refactoring my entire code into classes (I have never used them) was also a challenge, but was a great learning experience.
- I also started refactoring everything into a component based structure which I would like to finish.
